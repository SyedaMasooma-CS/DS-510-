- Get all the variables of interest in one dataframe for analysis

# Methodoloy
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Statistical Modelling for Inferences on the Data

# Visualization
- Since the data os timeseries and I need to look at the trends in data over time and relationship between trends of different variables, I have made mutilple plots.
- These include line plots and scatter plot of individual variables over Date.
- I have made lineplots of different variables in the same plot to visualize the comparison between trends.
- I have made interactive plots to see more detail of the data including growth and decline. I have tried to use more engaging colors to make the visualization more interpretable
